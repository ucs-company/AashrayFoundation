              <p>
                In a world where clean drinking water is a basic necessity, the{" "}

              <p>
                Clean drinking water is not a luxury; it's a fundamental human right. Yet, many
                underprivileged communities in Mumbai, New Mumbai, and Thane face the daily struggle
                of accessing safe and clean water sources. This challenge not only affects their
                health but also their overall well-being.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through <strong>AFLF Project Jal</strong>, we are committed to installing clean water
                facilities, purifiers, and distribution points in areas where the need is most acute.
                We work tirelessly to ensure that no one in our community has to go without clean,
                fresh drinking water.

              Through Project Jal, we have witnessed the transformation of communities. Families who
              once struggled to access clean drinking water now have reliable sources of safe water.
              Children who fell ill from waterborne diseases now have the foundation for good health.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every water facility installed, every purifier distributed, every life touched — these
              are the milestones that drive us forward. Together, we are building communities where
              clean water flows freely to every corner.
